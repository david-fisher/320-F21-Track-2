# Rule editor UI

This directory holds the source files for the rule editor UI. There is a single java package
`RuleEditorUI` with a main class of the same name, and a controller class `RuleEditorUIController`.
The latter will store a number of event handlers for the various elements in the associated FXML
document and the appropriate events which we wish to handle.
