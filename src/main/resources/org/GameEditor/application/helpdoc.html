<h1> Game Board Editor Help Document </h1>

<hr>

<p>There are a number of different components to the game board editor that assist the user in creating their own game board.</p>

<h3> Canvas </h3>

<p>The canvas is the large square that resides on the left of the screen, and it is where the user can generate game tiles in order to create their desired game board. Tiles on the canvas may be right clicked to be presented the options to delete a tile or to open the shape editor menu, which is explained in the 'shape editor' section.</p>

<h3> Add Game Tile </h3>

<p>This component of the game board editor resides on the middle-right of the screen. It allows the user to click buttons to generate squares or circles on the board. Any number of tiles may be added from the 'add game tile' component until the board is full.</p>

<h3> Shape Editor </h3>

<p>This component of the game board editor appears when the user right clicks a tile and selects the "shape editor" option. It allows the user to edit the attributes of a selected game tile. These attributes include:</p>

<ul>
     <li>'Name' - the name that can be attributed to the selected tile which will assist in the object and rule editors, which will be explained later in their respective sections.</li>
     <li>'Color' - the color of the selected tile, the default being black. This may help the user accomplish a desired aesthetic for their game board, or just to differentiate between different tiles.</li>
     <li>'Image' - the image that may take the place of the selected tile. This allows the user to create tiles other than the default squares and circles which may further help the user accomplish a desired aesthetic for their game board or differentiate between different tiles.</li>
     <li>'Border Color' - the color of the border on the selected tile. This may be used to help the user differentiate different tiles on their game board.</li>
     <li>'Current Connections' - Shows what tiles the selected tile is currently connected to. </li>
     <li>'Add Connections' - Shows all currently unconnected tiles that the selected tile can be connected to. The user can select unconnected tiles to add them to the list of current connections.</li>
     <li>'Remove Connections' - Shows all currently connected tiles and allows the user to select any of them to remove them from the list of current connections.</li>

</ul>

<h3> Tile Attributes </h3>

<p>The tile attributes tab resides on the bottom right hand corner of the screen. When a user left clicks a tile, it's set attributes (name,color,image,connections) will be displayed in their corresponding fields.</p>

<h3> Save </h3>

<p>This component of the game board editor resides in the top-right of the screen, amongst some other components. The purpose of the 'save' button is to store the current state of the game board on the local machine. This allows the user to exit the game board editor and not lose the edits they have made to their game board. This will then allow the user to select this stored game board from the template menu to continue edits later as was explained in the 'template menu' section.</p>

<h3> Exit </h3>

<p>This component of the game board editor resides in the top-right of the screen, amongst some other components. The purpose of the 'exit' button is to exit from the game board editor and bring the user back to the previous menu - the welcome screen.</p>

<h3> Undo </h3>

<p>This component of the game board editor resides in the top-right of the screen, amongst some other components. Removes the previously added tile. Keep in mind however that if no tiles have been added,(effectively a blank game board), then the user will be unable to undo, as there is nothing to undo.</p>

<h3> Redo </h3>

<p>This component of the game board editor resides in the top-right of the screen, amongst some other components. The purpose of the 'redo' button is to redo a previous press of the 'undo' button. The user may 'redo' as many times as they have done 'undo's. Keep in mind however that if nothing has been undone, there is nothing to redo, and thus the user will be unable to redo.</p>

<h3> Help </h3>

<p>This component of the game board editor resides in the top-right of the screen, amongst some other components. The purpose of the 'help' button has hopefully become obvious, as you are currently reading the result of pressing it. The user is shown the help document - the one you are reading right now - which explains the purpose of the various menus and components that form the game board editor.</p>
